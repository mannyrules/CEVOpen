> Recommendation: we include in the goal description and title a specifical, tangible result that readers will find compelling enough to want to learn more now, and follow along with.... that they'll understand that us reaching our proof-of-concept goal "means" they will be able to use the toolkit with which we accomplished our end-goal to reach their end-goal too.


# CEV Project

(CEV = ContentMine, EssoilDB and Verriclear, the 3 organizations which have started this project).

# The Challenge
Despite all the technological breakthroughs in data processing, one of the limits affecting formulators’ capacities to continually discover and develop new therapies are those restricting the speed of data aggregation and abstraction from high-quality research.

###The Solution: D.A.V.E.
This groundbreaking project will create a toolkit for searching and extracting high quality data from open science sources from which Verriclear™ will develop working phytomedicinal formulas that can truly make a difference.

The proposed toolkit — we are calling, “D.A.V.E.” — is intended to Download, Abstract, Verify and Evaluate high quality open-source research data.

D.A.V.E. will turn what is currently an enormously time- and labour-intensive task into a quick, automated and reliable one, by increasing the speed at which millions of research papers can be automatically:
* analyzed for relevant data signals, 
* scraped of selected keywords and data, and 
* aggregated into organized tables to then be analyzed and integrated offline.

The end goal being, a reliable process for near automated discovery of unique synergistic combinations of pure botanical extracts and/or their bioactive constituents holding untapped therapeutic potential.

We invite readers to follow and participate in our journey of development and discovery in our OpenNotebook study on Github at [URL].


# Goals
This project aims to mine the whole of Open-source scientific literature for plant chemistry (phytochemistry), to accomplish the following:

## The manifested results / end-goal proof of concept will be: 
1. The group will create a working toolkit — we are calling, “D.A.V.E.” — that will Download, Abstract, Verify and Evaluate high quality open-source research data.

2. Verriclear™ will use D.A.V.E. to develop affordable phythochemical treatments for suffers of:
* [neglected skin diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neglected_diseases) (“NSDs”) in marginalized markets ([Chromoblastomycosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromoblastomycosis), a fungal infection common in developing countries); and,
* two pervasive skincare needs (PSNs) in global markets ([Acne Vulgaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne) and [Photoaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoaging))."

It's inspired by Gitanjali Yadav's (GY) EssoilDB project http://www.nipgr.ac.in/Essoildb/ and heavily reliant on the content and contributors. 
While EssoilDB V1.0 used manual entry of data, mainly from closed access papers, CEV will crawl the Open Access (OA) literature and automatically extract plant and chemical data. We have no idea how successful this will be (that's research), but initial searches suggest that there are many thousands of OA phytochemical papers and it's OA that has made this project possible.

### Scientific accessibility
Phytochemical medicine is something that everyone understands at a general level and a high school student can soon understand the principles:
* plants produce a mixture of chemicals (often oils)
* oils from plants are used to treat or prevent diseases, kill insects and other biological activities

**However judgments as to whether the published conclusions are valid requires much experience and knowledge of the field** .
If people wish to volunteer they will need to show they are proficient in plant science/medicinal chemistry/data science.



### Hopes
We hope that we will be able to create a rapid proof of concept (PoC), which will give an indication of what phytochemical activites can be retrieved from the literature with current tools (a "scoping review"). It is NOT be a medically quotable result. It will also allow https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_analysis (the sectioning and labelling of parts of the document). Ultimately this will lead to the identification of the most important scientific objects in the document ("entities"). In time these will be incorporated into dictionaries which can automatically label objects such as:

* diseases
* instruments and procedures
* drugs
* countries
* institutions

### ContentMine
ContentMine (https://contentmine.org). was funded by the Shuttleworth Foundation (Fellowship to PMR) and Rik Smith-Unna created the critically important `getpapers` search and retrieval software. PMR created the `AMI` software for analyzing downloaded materials locally.

"We hope that this huge repository of essential oil profiles will facilitate unraveling of the true significance of volatiles in plants, along with creating potential avenues for industrial applications of essential oils. The data is available freely without any login requirement."

Because EssoilDB is created for free re-use we thank Gitanjali and NIPGR for the data in EssoilDB 1.0 (2019-08). Any additions and enhancements can be taken by EssoilDB and incorporated in later versions.

Headquartered in [Canada](https://verriclear.com) and [Brazil](https://verriclear.com.br), [Verriclear™](https://verriclear.com) develops phytomedicinal skincare treatments from bioactive extracts of common and rare plants sourced worldwide.

"Verriclear's proof-of-concept goal is to use this toolkit to develop affordable phythochemical treatments for suffers of:
* [neglected skin diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neglected_diseases) (“NSDs”) in marginalized markets ([Chromoblastomycosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromoblastomycosis), a fungal infection common in developing countries); and,
* two pervasive skincare needs (PSNs) in global markets ([Acne Vulgaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne) and [Photoaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoaging))."


## Volunteers and collaborators
Initially the project data will be created/extracted by EF and PMR; GY as advisor. We welcome volunteers of all ages; noting that Lars Willighagen while at secondary school did a great ContentMine project. However our time for training is very limited and you take us as you find us.
